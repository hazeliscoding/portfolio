# Hello, World!

I’ve wanted a place on my own domain to write short notes about what I’m learning, what I’m building, and what I’m thinking about in tech.

<!-- ![Blog placeholder image](/images/blog/placeholder.svg) -->

This blog lives directly inside my Angular app, using Markdown files that get turned into routes at build time.

## What I’m optimizing for

- Owning my content
- Keeping it simple
- Great performance and SEO

Thanks for reading — more posts coming soon.
